        This is a sample book about testing methodologies. Testing is crucial
        for software development and ensures that applications work as expected.
        
        ## 1.1 Types of Testing
        
        There are many types of testing including unit testing, integration testing,
        and end-to-end testing. Each type serves a different purpose in the
        software development lifecycle.
        
        ### Unit Testing
        
        Unit testing focuses on testing individual components or functions in isolation.
        This approach helps identify bugs early in the development process.
        
        ### Integration Testing
        
        Integration testing verifies that different components work together correctly.
        It ensures that the interfaces between modules function as expected.
        
        ## 1.2 Best Practices
        
        TESTING BEST PRACTICES AND GUIDELINES
        
        Following best practices in testing ensures that your test suite is maintainable,
        reliable, and provides good coverage of your application's functionality.
